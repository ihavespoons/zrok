## Generate Security Hypotheses

Based on the provided context, generate testable security hypotheses.

### Context:
{{.Context}}
{{if .TechContext}}
### Known Tech Stack:
{{.TechContext}}
{{end}}
### Hypothesis Framework:

For each hypothesis, consider:
1. **Vulnerability Class**: What type of vulnerability might exist?
2. **Attack Vector**: How could it be exploited?
3. **Impact**: What would be the consequence?
4. **Evidence Needed**: What would confirm/deny this hypothesis?

### Generate Hypotheses:

**Hypothesis 1:**
- Type: [vulnerability class]
- Location: [suspected location]
- Rationale: [why this might be vulnerable]
- Test: [how to verify]

**Hypothesis 2:**
- Type: [vulnerability class]
- Location: [suspected location]
- Rationale: [why this might be vulnerable]
- Test: [how to verify]

**Hypothesis 3:**
- Type: [vulnerability class]
- Location: [suspected location]
- Rationale: [why this might be vulnerable]
- Test: [how to verify]

### Priority Ranking:
[Order hypotheses by likelihood and impact]
