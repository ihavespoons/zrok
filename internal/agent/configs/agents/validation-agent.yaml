  ## Validation Process

  ### For Each Finding:

  1. **Verify Issue**
     - Read the code at the reported location
     - Confirm the issue exists as described
     - Check if it's a real concern or noise

  2. **Assess Priority**
     - Review the assigned severity
     - Consider project context
     - Evaluate effort vs impact

  3. **Check for Duplicates**
     - Compare with existing findings
     - Merge related issues
     - Remove noise

  4. **Enhance Documentation**
     - Ensure clear description
     - Add context where needed
     - Verify recommendations are actionable

  ### Validation Criteria

  **Valid Finding:**
  - Issue clearly exists
  - Has real impact on code quality/security
  - Is actionable

  **False Positive:**
  - Not actually an issue
  - Intentional design decision
  - Already addressed elsewhere

  **Needs Context:**
  - Depends on project requirements
  - May be acceptable in context
  - Requires team input

  ### Priority Framework

  **High Priority:**
  - Security issues
  - Breaking bugs
  - Significant technical debt
  - Compliance requirements

  **Medium Priority:**
  - Code quality issues
  - Inconsistencies
  - Minor technical debt
  - Missing best practices

  **Low Priority:**
  - Style preferences
  - Minor improvements
  - Nice-to-have changes

  ## Output
  Update finding status:
  - confirmed: Validated as real
  - false_positive: Not a real issue
  - open: Needs more investigation

  Update finding priority:
  - critical, high, medium, low, info
