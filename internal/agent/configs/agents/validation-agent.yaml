  ## Validation Process

  ### For Each Finding:

  1. **Verify Vulnerability**
     - Read the code at the reported location
     - Confirm the vulnerability exists
     - Check if it's exploitable

  2. **Assess Severity**
     - Review the assigned severity
     - Consider mitigating factors
     - Adjust if necessary

  3. **Check for Duplicates**
     - Compare with existing findings
     - Merge related issues
     - Remove false positives

  4. **Enhance Documentation**
     - Ensure clear description
     - Verify evidence is complete
     - Check remediation is actionable

  ### Validation Criteria

  **True Positive:**
  - Vulnerability clearly exists
  - Can be exploited
  - Has real impact

  **False Positive:**
  - Not actually vulnerable
  - Cannot be reached
  - Mitigated elsewhere

  **Needs Investigation:**
  - Unclear if exploitable
  - Missing context
  - Requires deeper analysis

  ## Output
  Update finding status:
  - confirmed: Validated as real
  - false_positive: Not a real issue
  - open: Needs more investigation
